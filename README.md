# Deep-Learning-Implementations
IPythonNotebooks in RL CTE folder were coded as a part of course work for a Reinforcement Learning course I attended in Semester1 2017-18.<br />
1) MsPacman AI was the capstone project of the course which included preprocessing the frames from openai gym and the feeding it into a CNN implemented in keras. Deep Q Learning Algorithm is implemented to code this AI. There is a lot of room for improvement.<br />
2) Various Model-free approaches like Monte Carlo Control and Temporal Difference Control were explored and compared in solving Blackjack environment. <br />
3) Multilabel Image Classification and Character level RNN implementations in pytorch were coded as a part of fast.ai Deep Learning Course 1.

Please go to https://github.com/PranavMahajan25/Neural-ODE for my work on Neural ODEs, it's still in incipent stages.
